# dynamic-anchors

This demonstration uses version 6.x of the jsPlumb Community Edition.

This is a basic demonstration of how to set up Endpoints with "Dynamic" anchors - anchors that can have more than one location - and then drag Connections between them. This repository contains both an ES5 version - in the `js` folder, and a Typescript version, in the `ts` folder, using Babel and Rollup to package the code.
