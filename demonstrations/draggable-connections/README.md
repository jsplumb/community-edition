# draggable-connections

This demonstration uses version 6.x of the jsPlumb Community Edition.

This is a basic demonstration of how to set up Endpoints and then drag Connections between them. This repository contains both an ES5 version - in the `js` folder, and a Typescript version, in the `ts` folder, using Babel and Rollup to package the code.
